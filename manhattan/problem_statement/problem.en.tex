\problemname{Manhattan Distances}

We have field $n \times m$ and $k$ hidden dots.
You need to guess positions of these dots by asking following questions:


Choose some number $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 10^4$).
Then output $d$ points $(x, y)$  $(0 \leq x \leq n$, $0 \leq y \leq m)$.
You will get $kd$ pairs of distances, i.e., all pairs of manhattan distances between hidden dot and queried dot, in some random (arbitrary) order.

You may ask at most $Q\in\{1,\ldots,  10^4\}$ questions.
