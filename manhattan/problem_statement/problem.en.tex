\problemname{Manhattan Distances}
We have field $n \times m$ and $k$ hidden dots.
You need to guess positions of these dots by asking following questions:

Choose some number $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 10^4$).
Then output $d$ points $(x, y)$  $(0 \leq x \leq 10^9$, $0 \leq y \leq 10^9)$.
You will get $kd$ pairs of distances, i.e., all pairs of manhattan distances between hidden dot and queried dot, in some random (arbitrary) order.

You may ask at most $10^4$ questions.

\subsection*{Interaction}

This is an interactive problem.
Interaction begins with you reading a single line containing four integers: $n$, $m$, $k$, $Q$ such that the width of the grid is $n$, 
the height of the grid is $m$, the number of hidden points is $k$ and the number of allowed questions is $Q$
We assume that $1\leq n,m\leq 10^9$, that $1 \leq k \leq 50$ and that $2 \le Q \le 10^4$.

You then ask at most $10^4$ queries of the form ``\texttt{?} $d$'' followed by $d$ lines each containingt $2$ integers ``$x$ $y$'' such that $(x,y)$ is a query point.
The response is a single line with $k *d$ integers in sorted order, all pairs of manhattan distances between the hidden dots and the queries dots.
Interaction ends with you printing a single line consisting of \texttt{!} followed by $k$ points $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, \ldots x_k, y_k$, separated by space.

Your submission is correct if you output all the hidden points. You may print them in any order.
\subsection*{Constraints and scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
Each test group contains a set of test cases.
Let $U$ be the number of queries you asked. Then for a test-group that awards $p$ points, you recieve $max(1,Q^3/U^3)\cdot p$ points.
Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.
