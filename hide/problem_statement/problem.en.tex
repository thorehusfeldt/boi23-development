\problemname{Shelter}

The planetary exploration vehicle \emph{Tycho VIII} needs to get back to the base after collecting mineral samples.
Tycho travels in a straight line from position~$0$ to home base at position~$b$ at a slow but steady maximum pace of $1$~unit per second.
Every second, Tycho takes $1$ unit of damage by the harsh planetary environment.

The situation is made even worse by radiation damage from the nearby pulsar, which adds another $d$ additional units of damage every $m$ seconds.
However, the radiation damage can be avoided by seeking shelter in one of $n$ different hiding spots---caves, vegetation, large rocks, carcasses of the planet's megafauna---along the way.
Tycho can choose to stand still at any point for any integer number of seconds.

The starting postion~$0$ and home base~$b$ are are considered shelters, so Tycho takes no radation damage there.

\medskip
What is the minumum damage Tycho will take on this journey back to home base?

\subsection*{Input}

On the first line, four integers, 
\begin{itemize} 
\item $b$ the location of the home base, where $1\leq b \leq 10^{12}$,
\item $m$ the frequency of the pulsar, where $1\leq m \leq 10^{12}$,
\item $d$ the additional radiation damage cause by the pulsar, where $0\leq d\leq 10^6$,
\item $n$ the number of shelters, where $0\leq n\leq 10^5$.
\end{itemize}
The following $n$ lines each contain the locations $a_1$, $\ldots$, $a_n$ of the shelters, with $0<a_1< \leq < a_n < z$.

\subsection*{Output}

Print a single integer: the minimum amount of damage Tycho must take to reach $b$.
