\problemname{Hide}

You walk along the $x$-axis, wanting to get from position $0$ to a given position $z$;
your walking speed is $1$ unit/s and you can decide to stop and stand still at any point. 
However, once youâ€™ve started walking you have to be hidden every $m$ seconds (\emph{i.e.}, $m$ seconds after you started walking, $2m$ seconds after it, $3m$ seconds etc.). 
Originally, there are $n$ hiding spots, located at positions $a_1 , \ldots , a_n$, and you can create as many additional hiding spots as you like before you start walking.
However, adding such a hiding spot takes $c$ seconds (regardless of its location).
What is the minimum amount of time necessary to get to $u$ under these circumstances?
