\problemname{Shelter}

The planetary exploration vehicle \emph{Tycho VIII} needs to get back to the base after collecting mineral samples.
Tycho travels in a straight line from position~$0$ to home base at position~$b$ at a slow but steady maximum pace of $1$~unit per second.
Every second, Tycho takes $1$ unit of environmental damage by the harsh planetary conditions.

The situation is made even worse by radiation damage from the nearby pulsar, which adds $d$ additional units of damage every $m$ seconds.
However, the radiation damage can be avoided by seeking shelter in one of $n$ different hiding spots---caves, vegetation, large rocks, carcasses of the planet's megafauna---along the way.
Tycho can choose to stand still at any point for any integer number of seconds.

Consider the situation where home base is at position $18$, there are shelters at positions $8$ and $15$.
Assume that the pulsar's period is $4$, so an unsheltered Tycho would take damage at time $4$, $8$, $12$, etc.

If Tycho leaves at time $0$ (where he is sheltered), he can reach the first shelter after $8$ seconds, incurring radiation damage $d$ at time $4$ (but none at time $8$ because he is sheltered there.)
Continuing without stopping, he would reach home base at time $18$, incurring $8$ more ratiation damage (at time $12$ and $18$, respectively).
Total radation damage is $d+d+d=3d$, the environmental damage is $18$.

If instead Tycho waits at the $2$nd shelter (at position $15$) for $1$ second, the pulse at time $16$ causes him no damage, and he reaches the shelter at time $19$ for a total of $2d + 19$ dmage.

The starting postion~$0$ and home base~$b$ are are considered shelters, so Tycho takes no radation damage there.

What is the minumum damage Tycho will take on this journey back to home base?

\subsection*{Input}

The first line consists of four integers $b$, $p$, $d$, and $n$, separated by space:
the location $b$ of the home base,
the pulsar's period~$p$,
the additional radiation damage~$d$ caused by the pulsar,
the number~$n$ of shelters.
The following $n$~lines each contain an integer giving the shelter locations $a_1$, $\ldots$, $a_n$, with 
$0<a_i< b$ for $1\leq i \leq n$ % constraint:shelterbounds
and 
$a_1<\cdots <a_n$. % constraint:sortedshelters

\subsection*{Output}

Print a single integer: the minimum amount of damage Tycho must take to reach $b$.

\subsection*{Constraints and Scoring}

You can assume
$p < b$ % constraint:pulsehappens
and
$n < b$. % constraint:sheltersfit
We always have
$1\leq b\leq 10^{12}$, % constraint:b
$0\leq d \leq 10^6$, %constraint:d
and
$0\leq n \leq 10^5$. % constraint:n

Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
Each test group contains a set of test cases.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.
