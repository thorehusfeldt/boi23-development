\problemname{Sequence}

A sequence of positive integers $x_1,\ldots,x_m$ is \emph{good} if  $x_1 = 1$ and for each $1 < j \leq m$ we either have $x_j=x_{j-1}+1$ or $x_j=x_k\cdot x_l$ for some $k$ and $l$ with $0< k\leq l< j$.
The sequences~$1,1$ and $1,2$ are both good; the sequence~$1,3$ is not.

For  $n$ given integers $w_1,\ldots,w_n$ define 
the \emph{weight} of the integer sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_m$ with $1\leq x_j \leq n$ for each $1\leq j\leq m$ as
\[ w_{x_1} +\cdots +w_{x_m}\,.\] 
For instance, given the weights $10, 42, 1$, the weight of the sequence~$1,1$ is $20$ and the weight of sequence~$1,3$ is $11$.
Define $s_i$ as the smallest weight of a good sequence containing $i$.

You task is to determine the values $s_1,\ldots ,s_n$.

\subsection*{Input}

The first line of input consists of the integer $n$: the number of weights.
The next $n$ lines of contain the integer weights $w_1, \ldots, w_n$.

\subsection*{Output}

Print $n$ lines, each containing a single integer.
For each $1\leq j \leq n$, the $j$th line consists of the smallest weight of a good sequence that contains~$j$.

\subsection{Constraints and Scoring}

We always have
$1\leq n \leq 10\,000$ % contraint:n
and
$1\leq w_i \leq 10^6$ for each $1\leq i \leq n$.% constraint:wi

Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
Each test group contains a set of test cases.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.

Group & Points & Constraints \\\hline
$1$   & $23$ & $n\leq 10$ \\
$2$   & $21$ & $n\leq 30$, $w_1=\cdots=w_n = 1$ \\
$3$   & $22$ & $n\leq 1400$, $w_1=\cdots=w_n = 1$ \\
